A graph is a non-linear data structure, used to represent a set of relationships(edges) among a set of things(vertices).

Since, now it is known what a graph is, next task is to represent a graph. The two most common ways to represent a graph are an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-and-its-representations/

Once it is clear on what is a graph and how to represent it, the next thing to do is to know how to traverse a graph. BFS and DFS are the one of the most common graph traversal algorithms. 

Implementations of all graph algorithms that are commonly used are described here.
